wow. just wow. just emerged from the theater with half a mind still stapled inside that chaos of kung fu and glorious landscapes... back's aching and yeah popcorn crumbs all over me. who knew a napkin is so important. 

first off, the opening scene grabs you like a catapult into Genghis Khan's chestplate. you feel this rush, like running downhill not knowing where you'll end up. there’s this one fight—arms like helicopters—bodies flying in all directions that I swear reminded me of that time we tried to fix the garage door spring. i mean HOW do they float like butterflies but sting like an entire hive? 

> I remember someone in the row behind me sneezed right as the protagonist dropped wisdom like a leaf falls in autumn...seriously, it’s like arguing with a bag of cheetos. suddenly you forget your point and all that's left is orange dust and confusion.

jeez, the colors. think of a 𝘗𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘤𝘬 exploding in slow-motion — there’s your palette. Do they 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   in some color-enhancing software before showing it? because dang. also cannot get this one line out of my head, something about dragons and eagles, but then my phone vibrated — thanks, uncles update chain — and I lost it. 

oh, and the sound? yeah. sometimes it’s like a thousand violins were dueling with a thousand drums while epicness rained down from the heavens. other times, they managed silences that made the whole theater hold its collective breath, despite a chorus of popcorn crunches echoing around. still reminds me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to catch the bits my ears missed during my popcorn intermissions.

...although, honestly, I kind of spaced out in middle there— blame the seat, too soft, like... like sitting on a marshmallow that forgot its dream. I know you asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if I had to, to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it later, but I’m thinking it’s worth another trip to the box office — sticky floors and all.

definitely feel like I left with less brain cells but more heartbeats. classic case of math not adding up.   like a puppy that grew wings and tried to fly into the sunset. mind=scrambled.

just makes me want to talk in old-timey wisdom-wrapped riddles all day now. 
I can't make sense of it. not sure I want to. 
anyway, my brain battery's low.

        pass
